    <h3>Wikipedia &amp; Cheese</h3>
    <p>Wikipedia can tell us tons of information about cheese.</p>
    <blockquote>
      Cheese is a food derived from milk that is produced in a wide range of
      flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It
      comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo,
      goats, or sheep.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      During production, the milk is usually acidified, and adding the enzyme
      rennet causes coagulation. The solids are separated and pressed into final
      form. Some cheeses have molds on the rind or throughout. Most cheeses melt
      at cooking temperature.
